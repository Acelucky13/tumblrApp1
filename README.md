# Project 5 - *Tumblr*

Submitted by: **Miguel Gomez**

**Tumblr** is an app that I build to showcase how a Tumblr app works, and it's ios abilities, integrated with real life data.

Time spent: **24** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] App has a configured table view and table view call
- [ ] App populates the table view with data fetched from an API


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] App fetches posts from a different Tumblr blog
- [ ] App has a refresh control to update the table view

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [ ] The only thing i'd change is the ability to find easier blogs to add to the app, and easier methods to fix size, and fonts.

## Video Walkthrough

Here is a reminder on how to embed Loom videos on GitHub. Feel free to remove this reminder once you upload your README.

## Notes

I met a challenge while trying to fetch real life data for my app to add, and resizing the app, fonts.
